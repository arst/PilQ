# PilQ

:iphone: Xamarin.Android application that allows you to count pills.
One of the most annoying parts of clinical trials is a necessity to count pills, that irresponsible patients decided not to take. So I created this small application for my wife to make her life and life of her colleagues a little bit easier.
:pill: Works with round and quadratic pills. :pill:
