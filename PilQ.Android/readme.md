# PilQ
Xamarin.Android application for pills counting.
One of the most annoying work included in a clinical trial is a pills counting. So I created this small application for my wife to make her life a little bit easier.
For now it works only with round - like pills. But I'm gonna add more shapes.

#Recognition
Application uses Accord.Net library for recognition related stuff.

#Usage
Launch application and click Camera button
